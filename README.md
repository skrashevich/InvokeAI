## Getting Started with InvokeAI

For full installation and upgrade instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/)

### Automatic Installer (suggested for 1st time users)

1. Go to the bottom of the [Latest Release Page](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI/releases/latest)

2. Download the .zip file for your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux).

3. Unzip the file.

4. If you are on Windows, double-click on the `install.bat` script. On
macOS, open a Terminal window, drag the file `install.sh` from Finder
into the Terminal, and press return. On Linux, run `install.sh`.

5. You'll be asked to confirm the location of the folder in which
to install InvokeAI and its image generation model files. Pick a
location with at least 15 GB of free memory. More if you plan on
installing lots of models.

6. Wait while the installer does its thing. After installing the software,
the installer will launch a script that lets you configure InvokeAI and
select a set of starting image generaiton models.

7. Find the folder that InvokeAI was installed into (it is not the
same as the unpacked zip file directory!) The default location of this
folder (if you didn't change it in step 5) is `~/invokeai` on
Linux/Mac systems, and `C:\Users\YourName\invokeai` on Windows. This directory will contain launcher scripts named `invoke.sh` and `invoke.bat`.

8. On Windows systems, double-click on the `invoke.bat` file. On
macOS, open a Terminal window, drag `invoke.sh` from the folder into
the Terminal, and press return. On Linux, run `invoke.sh`

9. Press 2 to open the "browser-based UI", press enter/return, wait a
minute or two for Stable Diffusion to start up, then open your browser
and go to http://localhost:9090.

10. Type `banana sushi` in the box on the top left and click `Invoke`

### Command-Line Installation (for users familiar with Terminals)

You must have Python 3.9 or 3.10 installed on your machine. Earlier or later versions are
not supported.

1. Open a command-line window on your machine. The PowerShell is recommended for Windows.
2. Create a directory to install InvokeAI into. You'll need at least 15 GB of free space:

    ```terminal
    mkdir invokeai
    ````

3. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` inside this directory and activate it:

    ```terminal
    cd invokeai
    python -m venv .venv --prompt InvokeAI
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment (do it every time you run InvokeAI)

    _For Linux/Mac users:_

    ```sh
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    _For Windows users:_

    ```ps
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

5. Install the InvokeAI module and its dependencies. Choose the command suited for your platform & GPU.

    _For Windows/Linux with an NVIDIA GPU:_

    ```terminal
    pip install InvokeAI[xformers] --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
    ```

    _For Linux with an AMD GPU:_

    ```sh
    pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/rocm5.2
    ```

    _For Macintoshes, either Intel or M1/M2:_

    ```sh
    pip install InvokeAI --use-pep517
    ```

6. Configure InvokeAI and install a starting set of image generation models (you only need to do this once):

    ```terminal
    invokeai-configure
    ```

7. Launch the web server (do it every time you run InvokeAI):

    ```terminal
    invokeai --web
    ```

8. Point your browser to http://localhost:9090 to bring up the web interface.
9. Type `banana sushi` in the box on the top left and click `Invoke`.

Be sure to activate the virtual environment each time before re-launching InvokeAI,
using `source .venv/bin/activate` or `.venv\Scripts\activate`.

### Detailed Installation Instructions

This fork is supported across Linux, Windows and Macintosh. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver). For full installation and upgrade
instructions, please see:
[InvokeAI Installation Overview](https://invoke-ai.github.io/InvokeAI/installation/INSTALL_SOURCE/)

## Hardware Requirements

InvokeAI is supported across Linux, Windows and macOS. Linux
users can use either an Nvidia-based card (with CUDA support) or an
AMD card (using the ROCm driver).
